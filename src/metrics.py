    """Event Detection Average Precision, an AUCPR metric for event detection in
    time series and video.

    This metric is similar to IOU-threshold average precision metrics commonly
    used in object detection. For events occuring in time series, we replace the
    IOU threshold with a time tolerance.

    Submissions are evaluated on the average precision of detected events,
    averaged over timestamp error tolerance thresholds, averaged over event
    classes.

    Detections are matched to ground-truth events within error tolerances, with
    ambiguities resolved in order of decreasing confidence.

    Detailed Description
    --------------------
    Evaluation proceeds in four steps:

    1. Selection - (optional) Predictions not within a series' scoring
    intervals are dropped.
    2. Assignment - Predicted events are matched with ground-truth events.
    3. Scoring - Each group of predictions is scored against its corresponding
    group of ground-truth events via Average Precision.
    4. Reduction - The multiple AP scores are averaged to produce a single
    overall score.

    Selection

    With each series there may be a defined set of scoring intervals giving the
    intervals of time over which zero or more ground-truth events might be
    annotated in that series. A prediction will be evaluated only if it falls
    within a scoring interval. These scoring intervals can be chosen to improve
    the fairness of evaluation by, for instance, ignoring edge-cases or
    ambiguous events.

    It is recommended that, if used, scoring intervals be provided for training
    data but not test data.

    Assignment

    For each set of predictions and ground-truths within the same `event x
    tolerance x series_id` group, we match each ground-truth to the
    highest-confidence unmatched prediction occurring within the allowed
    tolerance.

    Some ground-truths may not be matched to a prediction and some predictions
    may not be matched to a ground-truth. They will still be accounted for in
    the scoring, however.

    Scoring

    Collecting the events within each `series_id`, we compute an Average
    Precision score for each `event x tolerance` group. The average precision
    score is the area under the (step-wise) precision-recall curve generated by
    decreasing confidence score thresholds over the predictions. In this
    calculation, matched predictions over the threshold are scored as TP and
    unmatched predictions as FP. Unmatched ground-truths are scored as FN.

    Reduction

    The final score is the average of the above AP scores, first averaged over
    tolerance, then over event.

    Parameters
    ----------
    solution : pd.DataFrame, with columns:

        `series_id_column_name` identifier for each time series

        `time_column_name` the time of occurence for each event as a numeric type

        `event_column_name` class label for each event

        The solution contains the time of occurence of one or more types of
        event within one or more time series. The metric expects the solution to
        contain the same event types as those given in `tolerances`.

        When `use_scoring_intervals == True`, you may include `start` and `end`
        events to delimit intervals within which detections will be scored.
        Detected events (from the user submission) outside of these events will
        be ignored.

    submission : pd.DataFrame, with columns as above and in addition:

        `score_column_name` the predicted confidence score for the detected event

    tolerances : Dict[str, List[float]]

        Maps each event class to a list of timestamp tolerances used
        for matching detections to ground-truth events.

    use_scoring_intervals: bool, default False

        Whether to ignore predicted events outside intervals delimited
        by `'start'` and `'end'` events in the solution. When `False`,
        the solution should not include `'start'` and `'end'` events.
        See the examples for illustration.

    Returns
    -------
    event_detection_ap : float
        The mean average precision of the detected events.

    Examples
    --------
    Detecting `'pass'` events in football:
    >>> column_names = {
    ...     'series_id_column_name': 'video_id',
    ...     'time_column_name': 'time',
    ...     'event_column_name': 'event',
    ...     'score_column_name': 'score',
    ... }
    >>> tolerances = {'pass': [1.0]}
    >>> solution = pd.DataFrame({
    ...     'video_id': ['a', 'a'],
    ...     'event': ['pass', 'pass'],
    ...     'time': [0, 15],
    ... })
    >>> submission = pd.DataFrame({
    ...     'video_id': ['a', 'a', 'a'],
    ...     'event': ['pass', 'pass', 'pass'],
    ...     'score': [1.0, 0.5, 1.0],
    ...     'time': [0, 10, 14.5],
    ... })
    >>> score(solution, submission, tolerances, **column_names)
    1.0

    Increasing the confidence score of the false detection above the true
    detections decreases the AP.
    >>> submission.loc[1, 'score'] = 1.5
    >>> score(solution, submission, tolerances, **column_names)
    0.6666666666666666...

    Likewise, decreasing the confidence score of a true detection below the
    false detection also decreases the AP.
    >>> submission.loc[1, 'score'] = 0.5  # reset
    >>> submission.loc[0, 'score'] = 0.0
    >>> score(solution, submission, tolerances, **column_names)
    0.8333333333333333...

    We average AP scores over tolerances. Previously, the detection at 14.5
    would match, but adding smaller tolerances gives AP scores where it does
    not match. This results in both a FN, since the ground-truth wasn't
    detected, and a FP, since the detected event matches no ground-truth.
    >>> tolerances = {'pass': [0.1, 0.2, 1.0]}
    >>> score(solution, submission, tolerances, **column_names)
    0.3888888888888888...

    We also average over time series and over event classes.
    >>> tolerances = {'pass': [0.5, 1.0], 'challenge': [0.25, 0.50]}
    >>> solution = pd.DataFrame({
    ...     'video_id': ['a', 'a', 'b'],
    ...     'event': ['pass', 'challenge', 'pass'],
    ...     'time': [0, 15, 0],  # restart time for new time series b
    ... })
    >>> submission = pd.DataFrame({
    ...     'video_id': ['a', 'a', 'b'],
    ...     'event': ['pass', 'challenge', 'pass'],
    ...     'score': [1.0, 0.5, 1.0],
    ...     'time': [0, 15, 0],
    ... })
    >>> score(solution, submission, tolerances, **column_names)
    1.0

    By adding scoring intervals to the solution, we may choose to ignore
    detections outside of those intervals.
    >>> tolerances = {'pass': [1.0]}
    >>> solution = pd.DataFrame({
    ...     'video_id': ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a'],
    ...     'event': ['start', 'pass', 'pass', 'end'],
    ...     'time': [0, 10, 20, 30],
    ... })
    >>> submission = pd.DataFrame({
    ...     'video_id': ['a', 'a', 'a'],
    ...     'event': ['pass', 'pass', 'pass'],
    ...     'score': [1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
    ...     'time': [10, 20, 40],
    ... })
    >>> score(solution, submission, tolerances, **column_names, use_scoring_intervals=True)
    1.0
